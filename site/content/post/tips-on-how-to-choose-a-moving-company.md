## 1. Find out their reputation

If you are able to talk to a family member, or colleague for the recommendation of a moving company it is a fantastic opportunity to get an honest assessment of the business. There are a lot of reviews online on sites like Yelp, Google Reviews, Angie's List, MyMovingReviews.com, and the Better Business Bureau.

When reading reviews, be aware of how the previous customers have described the attitude of the moving company throughout the entire process and how they handled specific issues. If there are just some negative reviews, take a look at them and consider whether that client was particular or has placed fault in the wrong way. If the company has a lot of negative reviews, it is best to avoid the reviews.

## 2. Get Estimates

Estimates are a good method to compare the costs of moving firms. Do your homework about companies that do not provide estimates in person which can be an indication of fraud. If no in-person visit is made to determine what the task will require it could be a indication of fraud or simply a lack of. An adequate amount of moving quotes on-site to collect would be three or four.

Take note of any special furniture or needs for moving. Are you a musician such as an instrument like a piano? Equipment for gym and sports? Pool and grills? In general, companies will showcase specialized skills on its website, however reviews can also be a great source to find out what specializations the company that moves can boast of.

A reliable moving company might call these "added-value service". Other added-value services could include the installation of a rigging system or the offer of professional cleaning services following the move, and using specially-designed boxes to carry the mentioned objects and artifacts, and much more.

Think about the specific needs of moving you face and determine the company that can meet them most effectively. This is an important aspect to think about when you work out the right moving company for you.

## 4. Make sure the Mover is licensed

After you've compared prospective moving companies' ratings estimates, their rates, and additional value services, you should conduct more research and confirm that a moving company is legally able to move you from your old address to your new residence. A moving company has to be licensed by the Department of Transportation or the Public Utilities Commission. If you're moving across the country or internationally, the firm must be vetted by a variety of agencies. Many moving companies do not utilize insurance, so be sure to be sure to check that as well.
