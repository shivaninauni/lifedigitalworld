  How To Apply For China Passport and Visa
---
<!--StartFragment-->

By far the most straightforward option is to apply in your home country. If your country of residence is different, the Chinese authorities may charge an extra processing fee for non-citizens. Either way, you’ll need to fill out a form giving a proposed itinerary for your trip (it’s advisable to never mention Xinjiang and Tibet in your application), plus a flight ticket, and proof of accommodation booked for your first night in China.

Some embassies require extra documentation, such as an invitation letter from a person or a company in China, bank statements, and documents proving your employment record. And your passport needs to be valid for at least 6 months beyond the expiry date of your visa. 

Remember that it can be hard to obtain a Chinese tourist visa from an embassy or consulate outside your home country. Caravanistan publishes a useful list of which Chinese embassies accept applications from third-country citizens.

## How much does a China tourist visa cost?

The cost of a Chinese tourist visa varies depending on the type of visa, the length of stay, the number of entries allowed, and your nationality. Most tourists pay around US$35 for a single entry visa valid for 30 days from the day you enter China. Reflecting frosty relations between China and some foreign governments, UK citizens pay £151, US citizens pay US$140, Canadian citizens pay C$142, Australian citizens pay A$109 and French, German, Italian, Dutch and Spanish citizens pay €126.

Some nationalities are entitled to long-term multiple-entry visas that allow travelers to visit China for stints of 30 to 120 days throughout the duration of the visa. Note these are not residence permits and do not grant any right to live or work in China. Citizens of the US, Canada, Argentina and Israel can obtain tourist visas with a validity of up to ten years, Brazilians and South Africans are eligible for tourist visas valid for up to five years, while citizens of the UK can get tourist visas lasting two years. Contact your local Chinese embassy or consulate for the latest fees for long-term visas.
