Interviews for QA testers, analysts and managers can take a lot of time. Most likely, there will be multiple rounds. Interviewers will be most interested in your abilities as a QA professional, technical expertise, soft skill, and testing approach. There are no two companies that test goods the same way. As such, it is important to be open to learning new methods and approaches as a QA. These are some tips to help you prepare for your interview.

**Keep track of each assignment you complete**

It is nothing more than a project sheet. It should include the name of the project, the time and your role in it, as well as details about the software used, how the software was developed, implementation tactics, client details, and other details.

**Add retrospective notes**

After you've completed the project details, it is time to look through again and add some information about the challenges that you faced. What went well? What worked well for that task? ?

**Prepare for the questions**

* Software testers may be asked the following types of questions:
* Questions about the projects that have been completed so far
* Questions about your testing strategy
* Questions about the tools that you have used
* Questions about your responsibility and role in the team
* Questions about your knowledge

**Try being interviewed.**

Prepare a list of questions and then practice the interview with your friends or colleagues. You can also practice by reading past interview experiences and getting some [manual qa tester training](https://testpro.io/bootcamp/qa-engineer/).
