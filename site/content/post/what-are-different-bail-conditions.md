  What are different Bail conditions
---


In addition to determining the bond amount, which a person must pay in order to be released the court will typically place additional restrictions or conditions for defendants in making an inquiry into bail. The restrictions are similar to the ones imposed on those who are who are found in the commission of an offense and sent to probation. Failure to comply with [bail bonds in San Jose](https://www.allprobailbond.com/locations/california/bail-bonds-san-jose/) conditions could cause police to take the defendant back in custody until trial, and losing any bail payments.

The following are the typical bail conditions:

* **Pretrial Check-ins**. Similar to the process of checking in with a probation or parole officer, those on bail are required to attend regular checks with pretrial services officers. Pretrial service officers check on defendants before trial to ensure they're complying with any conditions or orders set by the court.
* **No-Contact Orders**. If a person accused is found guilty of stalking domestic violence, stalking and making criminal threats or other crimes of a similar nature the court usually imposes the order to not contact. The order demands that the defendant avoid contact with those who are believed to be victims of the crime.
* **Employment**. Courts may require defendants to keep a job during their time on bail. If the defendant isn't employed and is in jail, the court may oblige him or her to look for work during the time of bail.
* **travel restrictions**. Bailiffs are generally not permitted to leave the region unless they are specifically permitted by the court or the pretrial services officer.
* **Substance Abuse**. Bail conditions, particularly for cases that involve impaired driving or possession of drugs or any other drug-related offenses usually oblige the defendant to abstain from drinking alcohol or drugs.
* **Limitations on Firearms**. Bail conditions can oblige the defendant to abstain from carrying firearms, even if the alleged offense were not involving the firing of firearms.
